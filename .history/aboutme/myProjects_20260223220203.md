# My Code Projects

## Project 1: _The Ranch_

**The Ranch** was the final project of semester 1 and of programming 1 where we were tasked with making any sort of game we could immagin. I build a collection style game where the player must round up as many cows as they can in 2 minutes. This game allowed me to explore the use of object oriented codding and making global character classes re-used throughout the code. The game features a start screen, a main game screen with timer and scoreboard and a game-over screen with the ability to replay or quit.

### **Technologies used**
* Coded in Visual Studio 2022 _C#_
* Use of `Class` for Cows
* `DateTime` to keep track of game time and cow movement
* `ConsoleKey` to detect player input
* `String[]` allows many lines of text in one object
* `ForgroundColor` is used to color what is writen in console

### **Code Snippets**
```c#
        class Cow
        {
            public Int32 x, y, oldx, oldy, offsetx, offsety, health;
            public char cowchar = 'C';


            public void MoveCow()
            {
                oldx = x; oldy = y;

                offsetx = Program.GlobalRandom.Next(-1, 2);
                offsety = Program.GlobalRandom.Next(-1, 2);


                x += offsetx;
                y += offsety;

                if (x < 0) { x = 0; }
                if (x >= Console.WindowWidth) { x = Console.WindowWidth - 1; }
                if (y < 1) { y = 1; }
                if (y >= Console.WindowHeight) { y = Console.WindowHeight - 1; }
            }

            public Cow()     // this is a constructor its supposed to have the same name as the class
            {
                
                x = Program.GlobalRandom.Next(1, Console.WindowWidth);
                y = Program.GlobalRandom.Next(1, Console.WindowHeight);
                health = Program.GlobalRandom.Next(1, 101);
            }

        }
```
```c#
static void DrawCenteredMenu(string[] lines)
{
    Console.Clear();

    Int32 screenWidth = Console.WindowWidth;
    Int32 screenHeight = Console.WindowHeight;

    Int32 menuHeight = lines.Length;
    Int32 topPadding = (screenHeight / 2) - (menuHeight / 2);

    Console.ForegroundColor = ConsoleColor.Yellow;


    for (int i = 0; i < topPadding; i++)
        Console.WriteLine();


    foreach (string line in lines)
    {
        Int32 leftPadding = (screenWidth / 2) - (line.Length / 2);

        if (leftPadding < 0) leftPadding = 0;

        Console.SetCursorPosition(leftPadding, Console.CursorTop);
        Console.WriteLine(line);
    }

    Console.ResetColor();
}
```
