# My Code Projects

## Project 1: _The Ranch_

**The Ranch** was the final project of semester 1 and of programming 1 where we were tasked with making any sort of game we could immagin. I build a collection style game where the player must round up as many cows as they can in 2 minutes. This game allowed me to explore the use of object oriented codding and making global character classes re-used throughout the code. The game features a start screen, a main game screen with timer and scoreboard and a game-over screen with the ability to replay or quit.

### **Technologies used**
* Coded in Visual Studio 2022 _C#_
* Use of `Class` for Cows
* `DateTime` to keep track of game time and cow movement
*
